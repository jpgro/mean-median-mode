# Mean, Median, and Mode
## Description

Proyect that given an input, returns the **mean, median, mode, and standard deviation** of it. 

## How it works
1. First, if the user gives a list of numbers as input, the string is splitted and converted to list. 

2. Each value then is converted to float values. 

3. After the preprocessing of the data, the list is sorted. 

4. Then, it prints the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation using Numpy library methods. 

## How the proyect was inspired

- The project was inspired mainly by a Statistics lecture where this topics are seen, and I thought of a Python script to automate these calculations and compare my own results, with the ones of the script.
